- Decoupling (async operations) come at a cost

## Message Channels

- Queues (Point to Point) → SQS
  - Receiver pulls messages from a queue
- Topic (Pub/Sub) → SNS
  - Message is pushed to every subscriber

## SQS

- Standard Queue
  - at least once delivery
  - expect duplicates
- FIFO
  - limited performance

## SNS

- can target multiple destinations

## EventBridge

- easy to configure sources and targeted destinations
- Producer - where the event comes from
- Rules - event filters
- Receiver - Targeted by rule(s)
- Fan Out
  - Limited to 5 targets per rule
- SNS Fan out: millions of subscriptions per topic
- Best practice - Couple Eventbridge with SNS

## Patterns

- pub
- point to point
- fan out
- dead letter queue
