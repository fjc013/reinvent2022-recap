# ARC306: Multi Region Design Patterns

## Link to Session Recording

[Link to session recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilgpzlE7Hds)

In this session, dive deep on the topic of multi-Region design and explore different ways to implement such architectures. Consider how to think about multi-Region architectures and what is included from a cost, operations, and engineering perspective. Also learn about AWS service features that can help you build multi-Region solutions, including Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller, Amazon CloudFront Functions, Amazon Aurora Global Database, Amazon DynamoDB global tables, and more.

## Fundamentals

- Do we meet an extreme resilience requirement?
- Do we need to prove the workload can run in another region?
- Understand the data
  - specifically the availability
- Async replication
  - Needs reconciliation process for failover
- Sync Replication
  - Introduces 100x more latency
  - Acknowledgements not sent on replication failure
  - Sacrifice availability for data consistency

## Understand the Dependencies

- services
- features
  - e.g., DynamoDB Global Tables
- Internal & 3rd party dependencies
  - Identify on-premises dependencies
  - Identify any 3rd party solutions in the workload

## Failover Mechanism

- Never take a dependency on your primary region for failover
- Scrutinize all dependencies for failover

## AWS Account Management

- Regionalize Roles
- Check SCPs

> Never deploy to multiple regions at the same time
>

## Monitoring

- What changes in a Multi Region scenario?
- Use cross region monitoring
- Use Telemetry from Standby to trigger failover
  - e.g., externalize observations

## Cost & complexity

- Engineering effort
- operational effort
- typically 2x the cost

## Patterns

- Hub & spoke
  - static primary
  - multiple, localized read-only secondaries
- Pass the book / follow the sun
  - Failover primary to region as it comes into prime time

## Vangard Patterns

- Aurora → primary/secondary data stores
  - Aurora Global Databases
- DynamoDB → multiple primary data stores
- Using Aurora Global Databases
  - planned failover to move the primary
- DynamoDB doesn’t need failover
  - Built-in multi masters

## Look at MFT for ingestion

- Multi region SFTP service
- Abstract with Route53
- Replication of regional buckets to ensure data consistency
- Look at multi region access points

## 2 Macro Patterns

- Active Passive
  - 1 primary
  - 1 standby region
- Active Active
  - Using multiple regions simultaneously
- Active/passive
  - failover and failback
  - design considerations
    - observability
    - configuration drift
    - routing strategies
    - failover/failback procedures
- Unidirectional async data replication
- Backend: Aurora Global databases

## Active - Active

- extreme high availability
- Performance - latency sensitive
- Use cases
  - Global expansions
  - data locality - regulatory
- Key design considerations
  - observability
  - config drift
  - routing strategy
- Single writer - multiple readers
  - eventual consistency
    - async replication
  - Read heavy workloads

## Routing Patterns

- Route53
  - application recovery controller
- Cloudfront
  - lambda@edge
- AWS Global Accelerator

## Take Aways

- Don’t start with multi-region for resilience
- Multi-region is a business decision
- Build the business case first
- Don’t forget about internal and external dependencies
- Build deep observability
- Regions are independent failure domains
