# ANT205: Achieving Modern Data Architecture

## Session Recording

[Link to session recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzSsiAfWpU)

A modern data strategy is a comprehensive plan or blueprint to help you manage, access, analyze, and act on your data. Many organizations are developing roadmaps to help them achieve digital transformation. This session helps you understand how deploying a modern data architecture can help you navigate your data challenges, optimize analytics processes, and deliver faster insights to the people and applications that need it.

## Agenda

- Modern Data Architectures
- End to end lifecycle
- Data Governance & Data Mesh
- Towards Modern Data Architecture

## Insights are hard

- eliminate
  - data silos
  - people silos
  - Business silos

## Data Silos Canâ€™t Scale

- increasingly diverse
- more and more users need secure access
- Donâ€™t break the bank

## People Silos

- unique skill sets
- tool preferences
- required processes

## Business Silos

- Cost! ðŸ’°
- Legacy infrastructure
  - tech debt
- No agility

## Five Pillars to overcome challenges

- Unified analytics
- highest performance at lowest cost
- machine learning integration
- Unified data access
- insights for everyone

## Data Sources

- Database
- Analytics
- Data Lakes
- Business Intelligence
- Data catalog
- Governance

## Data Consumers

- People
- Apps
- Devices

## Unified Analytics

- Data access anywhere
  - federated query in Redshift and Athena
- Aurora Zero ETL to Redshift
  - Continuously move data from operational data store to analytics data store
    - SQL Interface
- Redshift Integration for Spark
  - Just point Spark connector to Redshift cluster
- Operational Log Analysis
  - OpenSearch
- Business Intelligence
  - QuickSight
- Interactive Query
  - Athena

## Highest Performance at Lowest Cost

- EMR Serverless
- OpenSearch serverless with Graviton
- Athena Fast-Startup
- Redshift
  - Fastest, cheapest data warehouse
- AWS Glue can scale!
  - Run some workloads on Spot Capacity

## Machine Learning

- Aurora ML
- Neptune ML
- Redshift ML
- Athena ML
- QuickSight Q

## Redshift ML

- Create and train ML models using SQL queries with SageMaker
- SageMaker models for in-database inferences

## SageMaker Studio

- Universal Notebooks
- Combined skill notebooks

## Data Governance

- Lake Formation
  - unifies data governance
  - Best for technical users
- DataZones
  - Catalog data with Business context

## DataZones

- Data catalog
- Organizational Domains

## Insights

- Focus on data, not infrastructure

## SageMaker Canvas

- No-code ML modeling and predictions

## QuickSight Q

- NLP business intelligence query
- has domain specific models

## Data Ingest

- Managed File Transfer
- DataSync
- Data Migration Services

## Storage

- Data Lake â†’ store on S3
- Data Warehose â†’ store in Redshift

## Catalog and Transformation

- Glue Data Catalog
  - Use glue to redact sensitive information

## Data Sharing

- Doesnâ€™t scale
- lacks discoverability

## Duplicating Data

- ETL pipelines
- Costly
- Brittle

## Data Sharing Patterns

- Single Account
- Hub and Spoke (centralized)
- Data Mesh

## Hub and Spoke

- centralized team is a bottleneck
- fails to scale
- lacks observability

## Data Mesh is Preferred

- provides discoverability
- Decentralized, lightweight federated governance across domain-oriented data systems
